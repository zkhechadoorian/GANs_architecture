# How to Make a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub

A pull request (PR) is how you propose changes to a project on GitHub. Follow these steps to contribute your improvements back to the original repository:

---

## 1. Fork and Clone the Repository
- Fork the original repository to your own GitHub account.
- Clone your fork locally and create a new branch for your changes.

## 2. Make and Commit Your Changes
- Make your improvements or bug fixes on your branch.
- Commit your changes with clear, descriptive messages.

## 3. Push Your Branch to GitHub
- Push your branch to your forked repository:
  ```bash
  git push origin my-feature-branch
  ```

## 4. Open a Pull Request
- Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
- Click the "Compare & pull request" button, or go to the "Pull requests" tab and click "New pull request".
- Select your branch and the original repository's main branch as the base.
- Add a clear title and description explaining your changes and why they are useful.
- Submit the pull request.

## 5. Respond to Feedback
- The project maintainers may review your PR and request changes or ask questions.
- Respond to feedback, make any requested changes, and push updates to your branch. The PR will update automatically.

## 6. Celebrate!
- Once your PR is merged, you have officially contributed to the project!

### Tips for a Great Pull Request
- Make small, focused changes (one feature or fix per PR).
- Write clear commit messages and PR descriptions.
- Follow the project's coding style and guidelines.
- Be respectful and collaborative in your communication.
